# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise, our client, would like analysis completed so she has a better understanding of how her fundraiser compares to other campaigns. Data was organized to review plays and to see their success rate.  

### Purpose
Data organized to create analysis of completed and successful vs failed vs canceled plays with comparison to their goal.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Data from the Kickstarter campaigns was sorted and organized to review and see the total number of successful, failed and canceled plays within Kickstarter.  Total projects were calculated, percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays were also calculated.  Line graphs were produced for Theater outcomes and for outcomes based on the goals of each play.  
Challenges were in bringing the total successful, failed and canceled amounts into columns based on goal ranges.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater plays produced in May or June had nearly double the amount of success rate, for example May had 111 successful campaigns vs December which only had 37 successful campaigns. The same can be shown while comparing June and January, June has 100 successful campaigns and January has 56 successes.  The failures trend to be steady throughout the year however the success rate is the dominant comparison.   



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals graph illustrate when the play has a lower goal, there is a high percentage of success achieved.  For example, Less Than 1000 and 1000 to 4999 both have over a 70% success rate however a goal of 45000 and above only see a success rate of 12% or lower.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It was difficult to successfully complete the countIF's totals by ranges. 

## Results

Plays produced in the summer months will be more successful for the play to reach its goal.  Winter months should be avoided as most attendees have other events to attend or other priorities for spending their entertainment dollars. 

The goal of a successful play campaign should have a low goal. The organizers should not be too aggressive with a goal and create a high goal because they will not see a success in reaching it.  

Limitations of the dataset are that we do not reflect details of location nor are any demographic details shared. 

Other graphs to create would be the years the plays are produced in comparison to success rate as that would illustrate world events that could affect the success rate.
